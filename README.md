# üê¥ Horse Tracker System

A full-stack web application designed to manage and monitor the status of horses in a stable or training environment. This system provides a clean, interactive interface to view horse data, track their status, and gain insights into their training progress.

---

## Project Architecture

The application is built with a decoupled frontend and backend, ensuring a clear separation of concerns.

* **Frontend (React):** A responsive Single-Page Application built with React and Material-UI.
* **Backend (Node.js/Express):** RESTful API that serves horse data via clearly defined endpoints.
* **Data Layer (In-Memory):** The project uses a simple in-memory JavaScript array to simulate a database.

---

## Features

* **Two Viewing Modes:** View horses in a responsive Card grid or Table view.
* **Dynamic Filtering:** Filter the list of horses by their status (Active, Resting, Injured).
* **Detailed Modals:** Click on any horse to view a detailed modal with health stats and training history.
* **Data Visualization:** A line chart within the modal visualizes the horse's training duration over time.
* **Notification System:** A notification icon in the header displays a badge with a count of horses whose vet checks are more than 6 months overdue.

## How to Evolve This System

To evolve this prototype into a real-world equine management system, I would focus on several key areas. First, I would replace the in-memory data with a robust **SQL or NoSQL database** (like PostgreSQL or MongoDB) to ensure data persistence and scalability. Second, I would implement **user authentication and roles** (e.g., for Owners, Trainers, Vets) to control access to sensitive information. Finally, I'd introduce a **real-time data layer using WebSockets** to instantly push updates to the frontend, such as live health alerts from IoT sensors on each horse, providing a truly dynamic and interactive monitoring experience.
